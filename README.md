## QuizTimer
I wrote this little tool for the "[Deutscher Quiz Verein Online Liga](https://www.quizverein.de/dqv-online-liga)" to simplify the time measurement during the game:

It's simple to use and can be embedded into [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) via [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). Currently [further documentation](https://elektroelch.de/quizTimer/) is only available in German. If there is any interest I can translate it to English.
